# teambot.py
Regardless of the fact that I do not have a great name for this, this discord bot generates random Pokemon teams in a [smogon tier](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Tier) of the user's choice. The user is given an import to use on [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

## How to run:
`YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` in run.py is where you put your discord API token.  
Teambot runs off of [the discord.py api wrapper](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py), so you'll need to use Python 3 alongside their package.

To install discord.py,  
`pip3 install discord.py`

To run the bot,  
`python3 run.py`

When you successfully [add your discord bot to your server](https://github.com/jagrosh/MusicBot/wiki/Adding-Your-Bot-To-Your-Server), the users will see something straightforward like this.
